# Quick Breakdown
### Object-Oriented Programming Demo

The Object-Oriented Programming demo illustrates a simple particle implementation using common OOP practises. Each Particle object has instance fields and methods together. In each itteration we loop over the particles and call the `update()` method.

Launch [BasicOOPDemo.java](src/com/company/BasicOOP/BasicOOPDemo.java) to see it run.
